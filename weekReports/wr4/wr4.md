## Basic terminology
* **File system:** The way files are stored and organized.
* **Current directory:** The directory where you are at the moment.
* **parent directory:** Moving backwards to the previous directory.
* **the difference between YOUR HOME directory and THE HOME directory:** When you open your terminal emulator, your current working directory is your home directory. When you open the file manager, your current working directory is the home directory.
* **pathname:** Which indicates the location of the file in the filesystem (like an address).
* **relative path:** The location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that us located inside the current working directory.
* **absolute path:** The location of a file starting a the root of the file system.
